## KAPA Telescope Simulator

The Keck All-sky Precision Adaptive-optics (KAPA) project will be a next-generation tomographic laser AO system, projected to begin operation at the W.M. Keck Observatory in 2024.  To test their AO algorithm, Keck has built a Telescope Simulator that simulates the KAPA system on a smaller scale and more controlled environment. The KAPA Telescope Simulator is being further modified to include a turbulence simulator, which includes a glass phase screen, to simulate typical atmospheric turbulence at various altitudes and wind speeds. This simulator must move extremely precisely in two-dimensions, and will do so via two precision translation stages.


## GUI

The turbulence simulator requires control from a GUI that adjusts different parameters necessary for the AO simulator’s function. This GUI will also control some AO parameters, such as the wavefront sensor’s gain, and frame rate, as well as have the ability to invoke other AO operational GUIs. The ultimate goal of this project was to create an intuitive GUI that could be used by astronomers and engineers alike. Here is a list of blah blah

- connection
- gain
- timer
